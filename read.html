    <p style="color: black;">Brownies are a typical American cake that was first recognized in 1897. A chef in America who was making a chocolate cake forgot to include Baking Powder so that it created a cake that did not expand but was delicious, the failure to make this chocolate cake actually created a new type of cake that became famous until now. The first Brownie recipe was published in 1897 in the Sears, Roebuck catalog.</p>
   <br> <p style="color: black;">The name brownies itself was taken because of the dominant dark brown color of the cake, plus because the raw materials also consist of various chocolates such as dark chocolate, chocolate paste & cocoa powder.</p>
   <br> <p style="color: black;">In its development, there are lots of brownies with various creations and varied flavors, their appearance is even more beautiful and inviting even though it does not leave the original characteristic of brownies which are rich in chocolate taste, either by adding toppings such as cream cheese, chocolate ganache, marshmallows, chocolate chips or sprinkles. various types of nuts.</p>
   <br> <p style="color: black;">In Malaysia, the first popular ones were roasted brownies cooked in the oven according to the original recipe, but in recent years a new type of brownies that is very popular has emerged, namely steamed brownies with a softer texture. Those who are creative have created various flavors of steamed brownies, ranging from the color which is not only brown but green and yellowish to the shape that is not only square but like a cake roll.</p>
    <br><p style="color: black;">Its development is certainly more indulgent for fans and connoisseurs of Brownies, the more appetizing to try and enjoy the various flavors of the variations.</p>
